  <p>I am an Architect Major who studied at the <em>Universidad de Sevilla</em>. I have been working in the field for six years and have grown from a Production Drafter to become a Project Manager of several ongoing projects from a FAANG client. Being that technology is such a crucial part of our present and future, I am inspirited to become an expert in web and app developing. My studies are currently focused on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am confident in my capabilities and intrigued to see what may come of this venture.</p>
